\description{
The data set includes synthetic EU-SILC data and is taken from the package \pkg{emdi}.
Originally, the data builds on \code{eusilcP} from package \pkg{simFrame}
and is reduced to 15 variables including the district identifiers as well as aggregated
household level covariates. Therefore, except for the variables \code{ratio_n} and
\code{district}, the variables are the mean values per district.

Title: Mixed Effect Random Forests for Small Area Estimation
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Patrick", "Krennmair", email = "patrick.krennmair@fu-berlin.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Mixed Effects Random Forests (MERFs) are a data-driven,
    nonparametric alternative to current methods of Small Area Estimation
    (SAE). SAEforest provides functions for the estimation of regionally
    disaggregated linear and nonlinear indicators using survey sample
    data. Included procedures facilitate the estimation of domain-level
    economic and inequality metrics and assess associated uncertainty.
    Emphasis lies on straightforward interpretation and visualization of results.

Description: Mixed Effects Random Forests (MERFs) are a data-driven,
    non-parametric alternative to existing models of Small Area Estimation
    (SAE). SAEforest provides functions for the estimation of regionally
    disaggregated linear and non-linear indicators using survey sample
    data. Included procedures facilitate the estimation of domain-level
    economic and inequality metrics and assess associated uncertainty.
    Emphasis lies on straightforward visualization and export of results.
